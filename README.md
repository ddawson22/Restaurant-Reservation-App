# Restaurant Reservation System

This application was built for use by restaurant personnel to handle reservations when a customer calls, seat reservations when they arrive at the restaurant, and free up occupied tables when guests leave.

Project Prompt: 

  You have been hired as a full stack developer at Periodic Tables, a startup that is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants. The    Product Manager has already created 8 user stories for Periodic Tables, and another developer has already written the tests for each of the user stories.

## Technology:

* Built with React.js, JSX, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Expressjs, Node.js, Git, Heroku, ElephantSQL, PostgreSQL, and Google Fonts

* This full stack application has built in unit, integration, and e2e tests. Each test is split up by user story. To install this application, you must: 
      * Fork and Clone this repository.
      * Run cp ./back-end/.env.sample ./back-end/.env.
      * Update the ./back-end/.env file with the connection URL's to your ElephantSQL database instance.
      * Run cp ./front-end/.env.sample ./front-end/.env.
      * You should not need to make changes to the ./front-end/.env file unless you want to connect to a backend at a location other than http://localhost:5001
      * Run npm install to install project dependencies.
      * Run npm run start:dev to start your server in development mode

* Additionally, tests for this application can be run for this application for each User Story by running npm run test:X where X is the user story number.
